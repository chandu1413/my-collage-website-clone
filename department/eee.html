                       <p>The Department is run by an accomplished Doctorate, Dr.A Sateesh Kumar who has 13 years of instructing experience. He is upheld by other 3 Doctorate, PG, qualified, experienced, PhD chasing after staff and the division has personnel strength more than that of workforce necessity standards of JNTUH. Refreshing information and cooperation/distribution in ISTE, IETE, Programs/Journals is the ordinary exercises of the staff in the division. We invest heavily in our staff; a self-trained group with commitment and is a combination of both intellectual and modern experience running after the development of the understudies and association. The field of Electrical and Electronics Engineering assumes a critical part in the public monetary development concerning power area, transport, industrialization and computerization. In EEE division, we give a few open doors to our staff and understudies, through in-house preparing, studios and preparing outside the school for additional development and improvement in their specialized topics. We are making a stage for understudies to accomplish the most amazing jobs they could ever ask for in Government areas, for example, NTPC, Power Grid, GENCO, TRANSCO, NPDCL, and SPDCL and so on and furthermore in programming and gadgets plan areas. We are submitted towards making proficient alumni local area, which is competent to deal with contemporary difficulties expected by the business and society.</p>
                        <p>Today, Electrical and Electronics Engineering is at the forefront of the modern Technology i.e Industrial development, Control Automation, HVDC Power Systems, Railway Electrification, Metro/ LEM based Rail Transport, solar systems, Electric Vehicles etc.</p>
                        <p>The EEE dept of this Institution has been established in the year 2008 with an intake of 60 UG students per year under R05 regulation of JNTUH. Now, the Department programs are expanded to 120 UG students per year and PG courses of PE and EPS specializations. During this decade period of expansion process, the dept is taking care of establishment of all full pledged labs of UG and PG courses effectively with day-to-day changes in syllabus to suit changing curriculum and updated labs as per JNTUH norms.</p>
